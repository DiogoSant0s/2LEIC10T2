# ChangeLog

## v0.3.0-Sprint3

### Added

For this version of the app (the final sprint version) we added the final functionalities related to the missions and the achievements and also improved and polished some other details related to the app aesthetics and functionality.

Firstly, the user can now complete missions and check his completed missions. The section with the completed missions can be accessed through the profile page.

</p>

The second big functionality implemented was the achievements/rewards system. The user can now receive achievements and rewards when he completes a certain number of missions, achieves a certain number of points or logins a certain amount of times. The achievements section can be accessed through the profile page. The achievements section is divided into completed and incompleted missions.

</p>


Besides the achievements and the missions systems, we also worked on some refinements to improve the user experience. 

The default animations were removed from the page transitions. 

The circle with the completion percentage of the current score goal has now a different color that contrasts better with the background.

## v0.2.0-Sprint2

### Added
In this version of the app, among other things, we added the score widget, where users can easily see their goal from the main
page, the remaning score that is necessary to reach it, score, and streak.
Futhermore, the plus button at the top takes the user to the score page where more detail is provided
and users can update their goal.

We have also added a mission widget where users can view ongoing missions.
Clicking on any mission displays its details on a dedicated page. Similar to the score widget,
we've added a plus button that, when clicked, directs users to the search page, where they
can look for new missions.
